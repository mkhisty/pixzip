Pixzip compresses images in an inherently novel way when compared to current compression methods. Currently, most compression algorithms scan the image for patterns, and encode the patterns in a way that takes up much less space than the raw pixels. Instead of doing this through a fixed algorithm, Pixzip's neural network first compresses the image into a tiny latent space. Then, another network is used to decompress it back to original dimensions. Through training, the model learns how to efficiently encode only the valuable data.

This method allows images to be compressed to a much greater extent. Even when the JPEG algorithm is set to maximize compression over accuracy, it fails to compress it as much as Pixzip. In addition to that, it still has significantly worse image quality.
