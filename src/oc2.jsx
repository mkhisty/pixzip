Another huge advantage over conventional compression methods is that the performance is dependent on how well training data resembles real life images that need to be compressed. Therefore, the more specific a use case is, the more advantage this method will have. For example, if a platform needs to store thousands of profile pictures, a model trained solely on profile pictures will do exceptionally well.

In this example, a face images dataset had been used for training.
